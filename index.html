<p>Openapphack is an attempt to enable end to end automation of Application Development using opensource tools for provisioning , code authoring and scaffolding.</p>

<p>Openapphack leverages vagrant, ansible and yeoman to do this. </p>

<p>The goal is to get a collection of fully functional , customizable apps working on the openapphack-vm  that can be customized by tweaking just a set of plain yaml files. </p>

<p>An <strong>OpenAppHack Project</strong> is a repository forked from the openapphack-vm repository.</p>

<p>You need to make use of the openapphack ansible roles and openapphack yoeman generators and build an impressive fully functional opensource application. </p>

<p>Openapphack is also the Top level Repository for all openapphack repositories </p>

<p>The others repositories used by the openapphack project are:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/WiproOpenSourcePractice/openapphack-vm"><strong>Openapphack-vm</strong></a> : Main repository which participants have to fork and will submit their pull requests.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/WiproOpenSourcePractice/openapphack-ansible-roles"><strong>Openapphack-ansibleroles</strong></a> : Repository for ansible roles that can be used by openapphack projects , You can also add your own ansible roles that work on openapphack-vm</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/WiproOpenSourcePractice/openapphack-yoeman-generators"><strong>Openapphack-yoeman-generators</strong></a> : Repository for the generators. You can also add your own yoeman generators that work on openapphack-vm, <a href="https://github.com/WiproOpenSourcePractice/openapphack-yoeman-generators/wiki">more info</a> </p>
